# Pytorch-Cat-Dog-Classifier
Implemented in Python 3.6 on Pytorch, trained the network(Resnet) on 4000 images of Cats/Dogs with different hyperparameter sets and obtained a validation set accuracy on 1000 images of 87%. with Transfer-Learning on a pre-trained Resnet-50 architecture on ImageNet, accuracy increased to 96%.
Total Dataset : 8000 images
Training dataset : 2000 images of cats and 2000 images of dogs.
Validation dataset : 1000 images of cats and 1000 images of dogs.
test dataset : 1000 images of cats and 1000 images of dogs.
